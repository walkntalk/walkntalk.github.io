## Issues

The script is being built on Windows 8.1 with the latest Chrome browser. Testing is being carried out on a Google Nexus 5 / stock Android phone.

The scripts makes a number of calls to Google servers. The first load is likely to take a long time or fail. Reload frequently.

If you edit the spreadsheet, it may be best to use a computer to see the results. The cache on your phone may prevent you from seeing updates in a timely manner.

When you need to use a mobile device for testing, it may be better to use 'incognito' mode as scripts are not cached.

## Bugs

* Clicking the header sometimes takes you back up to the top (Language level) when it should just go up a single level
